Operators
--------
operator is a symbol which will perform an operation.

int a=10;
int b=20;

int c=a+b;

a,b are called operands
+ = operators

Types of operators
----------------
1) Arithmetic operators   + - * / %
2) Relational/comparison operators  >  >=  <  <=  !=  ==
3) Logical operators   &&   ||  !
4) Increment & Decrement operators  ++  --
5) Assignment   =   +=   -=   *= /=  %=
6) conditional/ternary operator  ?:

Unary Operators: ++  -- =   +=   -=   *= /=  %=  !
Binary operators: + - * / % >  >=  <  <=  !=  ==  &&   ||
ternary operator:   ?:


Looping statements
-------------

loop  or iteration -  executing same set of statements multiple times.

1) while
2) do while
3) for loop


Initilization
condition
incrementation

Conditions

If
if else
Nested If

If Syntax

if(condition){
//code to be executed
}

int a =10;
int b=20

a>b
a<b
a=b

if else

Single  if and else
if(condition){
//code to be executed
}
else{
}


if(condition)
vkjvdv

vrre
v
vre
vr
vvr

Multiple Condition


if(Condition ){

}
else if(Condition){

}

else if(Condition){

}
else{

}

Switch

whenever we need to  excute one statement with multiple conditions


Syntax

switch(expression){

case value1:
 //code to be executed;
 break;  //optional
case value2:
 //code to be executed;
 break;  //optional
......

default:
  code to be executed if all cases are not matched;
}



For Loop

To iterate a program serveral times  based on some condition  with defined number of iteration

Syntax

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
//statement or code to be executed
}


for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){

}

for(data_type variable : array_name){
//code to be executed
}    


while(condition)
{
statements;
}



do
{
statements;
}while(condition);


for(initilization; condition ; inc/dec )
{
statements;
}


** which loop is prefered to use
-----
* If you know the number of iterations in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable.
* If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do-while loop is appropriate.
* If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based on a condition, the while loop is a good choice.


Bike --> for
bus -- > do while
flight ----> while

Jumping statements
----------
break
continue


control statements
-------
conditional ----> if   if--else   switch case
loops ----------> while    do-while   for
jump ------------> break  continue




Create family with 4 packages with family grandfather , Father  and son

Family
      grandafather
      father
      son

      Here 75  and son name as variable

 Print the statement in the grandafather class as

 granfather " "Krishna" age is 75 and my property goes to "tirupalu" "

 father  "tirupalu has "3" children  and names "chndra" "sunitha" and "pooja"

 son  "Chandra" am active and enthuism person in "agriculture" and habbit of swimming  and my is "26"

 family === MAIN METHOD === YOU NEED CALL ALL THE CLASS AND PRINT THE METHODS

 Practice bitwise operator topics .
