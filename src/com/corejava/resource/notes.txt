Operators
--------
operator is a symbol which will perform an operation.

int a=10;
int b=20;

int c=a+b;

a,b are called operands
+ = operators

Types of operators
----------------
1) Arithmetic operators   + - * / %
2) Relational/comparison operators  >  >=  <  <=  !=  ==
3) Logical operators   &&   ||  !
4) Increment & Decrement operators  ++  --
5) Assignment   =   +=   -=   *= /=  %=
6) conditional/ternary operator  ?:

Unary Operators: ++  -- =   +=   -=   *= /=  %=  !
Binary operators: + - * / % >  >=  <  <=  !=  ==  &&   ||
ternary operator:   ?:


Looping statements
-------------

loop  or iteration -  executing same set of statements multiple times.

1) while
2) do while
3) for loop


Initilization
condition
incrementation


while(condition)
{
statements;
}



do
{
statements;
}while(condition);


for(initilization; condition ; inc/dec )
{
statements;
}


** which loop is prefered to use
-----
* If you know the number of iterations in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable.
* If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do-while loop is appropriate.
* If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based on a condition, the while loop is a good choice.

bus -- > do while
flight ----> while

Jumping statements
----------
break
continue


control statements
-------
conditional ----> if   if--else   switch case
loops ----------> while    do-while   for
jump ------------> break  continue
